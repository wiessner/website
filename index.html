  <p>I’m a scholar of digital media and the environment, and currently a Postdoctoral Fellow 
    at the Digital Technology for Democracy Lab at the University of Virginia.</p>
  <p>I draw on media theory, science and technology studies, and political ecology to think 
  about how media forms and digital machines are grounded in people’s relations with the earth. 
  I’m especially interested in cultures of sustainable design and in hopes that new technologies 
  can align with natural processes to remediate extractive and exploitative resource systems.</p>
  <p>My current research looks at the emergence of mass timber architecture in the Pacific Northwest 
  of North America. Where did this movement to scale up the use of biogenic construction materials 
  come from? And where is it going? Through fieldwork and interviews, I look at how digital 
  technology is used to reposition the timber industry as low-carbon and high-tech; the tech industry’s
  embrace of mass timber construction systems; and the resulting implications for forests, housing, 
  and labor.  As managing carbon has become an imperative around which entire supply chains and 
  manufacturing systems are remade, sustainability is treated as a problem to be managed with 
  logistical and informatic solutions. These techniques for controlling resources in time and space 
  are powerful, but using them as tools of social and ecological repair obscure the uneven social 
  relations that have produced environmental degradation. </p>
   <p> I completed my Ph.D. in Media, Culture, and Communication at New York University in 2024; 
  I also have degrees in (environmental) history and (human) geography. Before coming back to academia 
  for my Ph.D., I worked in education and workforce development in my hometown, Baltimore. </p>
