  <p>I’m a scholar of digital media and the environment, and currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Digital Technology 
    for Democracy Lab at the University of Virginia.</p>
  <p>I draw on media theory, science and technology studies, and political ecology to think about how digital technologies 
    are grounded in peoples' relations with the earth. I’m especially interested in how technology shapes ideas about 
    sustainability, and in hopes that information technologies can align with natural processes to remediate extractive and 
    exploitative resource systems.</p>
  <p>My current research looks at the emergence of mass timber architecture in the Pacific Northwest of North America. 
    As managing carbon has become an imperative around which entire supply chains and manufacturing systems are remade, 
    architectural sustainability is increasingly being reconceived as a problem in need of logistical and informatic solutions. 
    Through fieldwork and interviews from across the supply chain for mass timber in Oregon and Washington, I look at why
    a movement to scale up the use of biogenic construction materials has emerged here, at how digitization in  
    design and construction has improbably enabled the timber industry to reposition itself as both low-carbon and high-tech, and at 
    what this growing industry means for regional forests, housing markets, and workers. I am currently working on a book about the industry, 
    <em>Digital Timber: Remediating Resource Economies and Automating Sustainable Futures.</em></p>
   <p> I completed my Ph.D. in Media, Culture, and Communication at New York University in 2024; 
  I also have degrees in (environmental) history and (human) geography. Before coming back to academia 
  for my Ph.D., I worked in education and workforce development in my hometown, Baltimore. </p>
