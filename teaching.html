 <p>I teach courses on media, technology, and the environment. In my classes, we talk everything from about the development of spatial media forms
  like outdoor cinema and GPS to the semiotics of green marketing; or from how debates around “thinking machines” over the centuries reflect changing
  social hierarchies to how people learn to think about race and the environment from country music videos.</p>
  
<p>From 2020-2024 I taught courses in the Department of Media, Culture, and Communication, where I completed my PhD. If you’d like to see a syllabi, please get in touch.</p>
